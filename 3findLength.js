const a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
console.log(a.length)

The confusion here seems to stem from how array indices work in JavaScript. While it's true that arrays are zero-indexed in JavaScript (meaning the first element has an index of 0), the length property of an array returns the total number of elements in the array, including the elements starting from index 0 up to the last element.

In your example, the array a indeed contains 9 elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Therefore, when you access the length property of the array with a.length, it returns the total count of elements in the array, which is 9.

Here's a breakdown of the indices and their corresponding values in the array a:

Index 0: 1
Index 1: 2
Index 2: 3
Index 3: 4
Index 4: 5
Index 5: 6
Index 6: 7
Index 7: 8
Index 8: 9
So, a.length returns 9, indicating there are 9 elements in the array a. The fact that arrays start from index 0 doesn't affect the length property, which simply counts all the elements in the array regardless of their indices.
